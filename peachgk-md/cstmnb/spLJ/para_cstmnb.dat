; This custom NB (nonbonded) interaction parameter file can be freely tweaked.
; You should also modify rdpara_cstmnb.F90 and cstmnb.F90 so that this 
; parameter files is properly read and executed by peachgk_md.

; CUSTOM NB parameters for specific part of LJ and Coulomb (real space) 
; calculation.
; The order of the potential parameters in the first line is as follows.
; <index> <rrcut> <rcut> <Ewald_alpha>
; (alpha parameter should be identical to that in peachgk.ini.)
; The remaining lines define the target pairs of atom type whose potential
;  energy is calculated.
