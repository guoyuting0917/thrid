; This custom NB (nonbonded) interaction parameter file can be freely tweaked.
; You should also modify rdpara_cstmnb.F90 and cstmnb.F90 so that this 
; parameter files is properly read and executed by peachgk_md.

; CUSTOM NB parameters for separately evaluating heat (momentum) flux
; associated with Coulomb interaction (real space).
; This enables us to completely split up Coulomb calculations for MD and 
; for heat flux evaluation using individual Ewald and cutoff parameters.
; The order of the potential parameters in the first line is as follows.
; <index(=1)> <rrcut> <rrcut_book> <nstep_book> <Ewald_alpha>
