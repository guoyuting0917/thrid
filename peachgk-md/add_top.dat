# Additional atom and topology definitions are described below.
# If you want to overwrite the current topology, specify the exact number in
#   the first colomn or the exact pair of bonded atoms.
# Or if you want to add new topology, specify a larger number than original 
#   number of bonds, angles, or torsions in the first colomn.
# For ATOM, you can overwrite mass and/or charge, but "setcharge" has priority
#   for setting charge.
# !!! Current version does not support adding new atoms, but only overwrite.
